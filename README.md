# Supplementary files for the manuscript (Comparing genetic architecture of MIR-predicted energy balance, a novel energy deficiency score and several biomarkers)

Supplementary file 1: Distribution of days in milk (DIM : 5-50) for retained test-day records.


Supplementary file 2 contains significant SNPs associated with LPNEB (FDR-adjusted p-values) and the significance tests for the genomic correlations shown in Figure 3.


Supplementary file 3 provides the mean absolute genomic correlation (MeanAbsCorr) values for LPNEB calculated for each chromosome.


Supplementary file 4 contains significant SNPs associated with LEDS (FDR-adjusted p-values) and the significance tests for the genomic correlations shown in Figure 4.

Supplementary file 5 provides the mean absolute genomic correlation (MeanAbsCorr) values for LEDS calculated for each chromosome.
